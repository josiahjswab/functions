        This was made to compare lists from the watch table when debugging in
        Visual Studios. <br />
        It is using the quotation marks around values to split the string into
        an array. <br />
        If you manually add any values please make sure to surround it with (")
        until I make it so it can handle multiple ways of entry.

export default Home
